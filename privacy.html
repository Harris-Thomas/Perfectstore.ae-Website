											<p>DATA THAT WE COLLECT
												<br>
												<br>
												This Privacy Statement explains how Perfect Store General Trading FCZ LLC and our UAE Affiliates collect, control, process, and use information about you (which we call “personal data”).<br>												
												When we say “Perfect Store General Trading FCZ LLC”, “us”, “our”, or “we”, we mean Perfect Store General Trading FCZ LLC. Perfect Store General Trading FCZ LLC is the operator of the Orallyfit App. It provides platforms where our UAE Affiliates, and other unaffiliated third-party sellers (collectively “Sellers”) can list offers for vouchers, deals, goods, services, and other offerings.<br>												
												When we talk about the “Orallyfit App”, we mean our platforms, which include our websites, mobile applications, communications we send or services we provide, social networking sites, or any other websites we offer that link to or reference this Privacy Statement.<br>	
												
												<br>
												PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES
												<br>
												<br>
												
										We routinely update this Privacy Statement to clarify our practices and to reflect new or different privacy practices, such as when we add new services, functionality, or features to the Site. If we make any material changes we will notify you, either by email (sent to the email address specified in your account), by means of notice on the Orallyfit App or by using other methods. You can determine when this version of the Privacy Statement was adopted by referring to the “Effective Date” above.<br>												
												You understand that your continued use of the Orallyfit App after we send a notice about our changes to the Privacy Statement means that the collection, control, processing, and use of your personal data is subject to the updated Privacy Statement. If you object to any changes, you may modify your account settings or close your account as described below.<br>												
												<br>
												1. PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT
												<br>
												<br>												
											We will collect the following personal data when you interact with the Orallyfit App:<br>
											          <br>
											          
												•	Authentication and identification information (e.g. your name, email address, and password). This information is necessary to set up and log you into your account, but you do have the option to make purchases without creating a password. If you don’t provide this, we may not be able to provide our full range of account services to you;<br>												
											•	Basic personal details (e.g. your name, date of birth, and nationality);<br>												
												•	Contact details (e.g. your postal address, telephone number, and email address). We may need some of this information to deliver products to you, such as your postal address to deliver physical products and your email address to send you vouchers, and won’t be able to carry out these services if you don’t provide it;<br>												
											•	Payment details (e.g. your credit card details or payment tokens from third party payment providers). We use these to process your order, and won’t be able to take payment from you or give refunds if you don’t provide it; and<br>												
											•	With your consent, information about your contacts with Perfect Store General Trading FCZ LLC (e.g. call recordings, instant messages on our App, and user generated content).<br>
											<br>
											
												Some information we collect is necessary for us to provide our services or meet our legal obligations. We will make this clear when we collect that information from you.<br>
												<br>
												
											We will also automatically collect personal data when you interact with the Apps through your computer, mobile device, or other device. This personal data includes the following:<br>
											<br>
											
											
												•	Analytics data (e.g. information about app downloads, app and web page histories), which may include data collected from cookies and other types of device identifiers;<br>
												
													•	Profile inputs (e.g. page and deal views on the site, purchase details, click information and information about the website you clicked to our App from). This may include data about your location. With respect to geolocation information collected from your mobile device, we will only collect this where you have provided consent; and<br>
													
													•	Device details (e.g. MAC address, IP address, bluetooth data and advertising identifiers).<br>
													<br>
													
													We also receive personal data and other online and offline information from third parties with whom we conduct business, such as merchants, co-marketers, distributors, resellers, and other companies or organizations with whom we enter into agreements to support our business and operations, including advertising partners and third party data providers that provide us with supplemental or additional information about our customers (collectively “Business Partners”).<br>
													<br>
													
													The personal data we receive from Business Partners includes basic personal details, contact details, device details, profile inputs, as well as:<br>
													<br>
													
													•	Demographic information, (e.g. details about age brackets and educational background);<br>
													
													•	Location data (e.g. information about postal or ZIP code); and<br>
													
												•	Purchase information from third party sites (e.g. information about purchases on other sites).<br>
												<br>
												
												We will only receive data from our Business Partners where they are legally permitted to share such data, and we will only process that data for the purposes described below. We use the data provided to better understand your preferences, deals that are relevant to you, and how our merchants are performing. By combining the data we collect directly from you with that received from third parties, we are able to provide you with a better, and more personalized, Orallyfit experience.<br>
												<br>
												
												We will collect the personal data described above at various stages in your relationship with us when you:<br>
												<br>
												
												•	Register, subscribe, authorize the transfer of, or create an account with us. If you choose not to create a password for your account, we create an account and link your purchase details to your email address during each purchase;<br>
												
												•	Visit any page online that displays our ads or content;<br>
												
												•	Purchase products or services on or through the Apps from Sellers;<br>
												
												•	Connect, log-in, or link to the Apps using social networking tools; and<br>
												<br>
												
												We also create profiles about you based on the personal data you provide to us or that is collected about you, as described above and including personal data that we receive from Business Partners. We do this to market offers to you we think you would be interested in buying. The contents of that profile include:<br>
												<br>
												
												•	Account details. For example, we create a permanent URL to your account page which may include your name. We also generate tokens to remember your subscription and purchase histories, and any loyalty numbers you may have obtained;<br>
												
												•	Marketing segment information. For example, if you purchase products or services related to wellness and beauty, we may infer that you are interested in these types of products.<br>
												
												•	Activity information. Based on your interactions with communications, we’ll generate personal data about how many communications you like to receive, so that we don’t send you more than are useful to you.<br>
												
												<br>
												1. YOUR CHOICES
												<br>
												<br>
												
												You can manage the types of personal data you provide to us and can limit how we communicate with you. At the same time, we think that the more you tell us about yourself and what you like, the more relevant and valuable your experience with our App and services will be.<br>
												
												You can manage your email, push notification, location information and subscription notification preferences by logging into your account through the Site or by adjusting the settings in our mobile application:<br>
												<br>
												
												•	Push notifications and location information. Your device and the Orallyfit mobile app provide you with options to control push notifications and how and when we collect your geolocation. You can disallow our use of certain location data through your device or browser settings, for example, by disabling “Location” services for the Orallyfit application in Apple’s iOS and Android privacy settings, or by disabling “Location” services for your device;<br>
												
												•	Subscriptions. You can also manage your subscriptions by following subscription management instructions contained in any commercial emails that we send you. You may choose to subscribe to some types of messages, and may choose not to subscribe to, or to unsubscribe from, others. You may update your subscription preferences at any time. Even if you decide not to subscribe to, or to unsubscribe, from promotional email messages, we may still need to contact you with important transactional information related to your account and your purchases from Sellers. For example, even if you have unsubscribed from our promotional email messages or push notifications, we will still send you confirmations when you make purchases on the Site;<br>
												
												•	Cookies. You can manage how your browser handles cookies. You may also manage how your mobile device and mobile browser share information on and about your devices with us, as well as how your mobile browser handles cookies;<br>
												
												<br>
												YOUR RIGHTS
												<br>
												<br>
												
											You can access, update, rectify, and delete your personal data which makes up some of your profile by logging into your account and clicking on the "Data request" button of this privacy policy. Keeping your personal data current helps ensure that we can respect your preferences and offer you the goods and services that are most relevant to you.<br>
											<br>
											
											In accordance with applicable law, you may (i) request access to any personal data we hold about you; (ii) request that it be updated, rectified, deleted or blocked; (iii) request that we delete personal data we hold about you; (iv) request that we restrict our processing of your personal data; and (v) request that we provide you or a third party with a copy of certain personal data about you (that is referred to as the right of “data portability”); (vi) object to any of our uses of your personal data described in this policy, including our marketing activities;<br>
											
											(vii) revoke your consent to the processing of your personal data, to the extent consent was required and provided by you; and (viii) request that we continue to process your personal data after we have fulfilled our purposes, if it is necessary to complete procedures relating to claiming or defending legal rights, or in connection with legal proceedings.<br>
											
											If you request a correction to your personal information but we do not make that correction, you have the right to request that we take attach to your personal information a statement that a correction was sought but not made.<br>
											
											Whilst we will typically comply with any request for you to exercise your data subject rights, there may be limited instances where, to the extent required or permitted by applicable laws, we will not immediately comply with such requests.<br>
											<br>
